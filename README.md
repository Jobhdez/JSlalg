# classesJS
wrote some basic vector and matrix classes to write comfortably in JavaScript.

## Progress
to start the project I have implemented an basic and incomplete vector class.

# Installation
Clone this repo.

Install Node.

Navigate to the src code directory.

Start Node by typing `node` in your terminal.

You can play with it by:

```
v = require('./linearalgebra')

v1 = v.Vector([3,4,5])

v1.vector // will output [3,4,5]

v1.add(v1) // will output Vector { vector: [6,8,10] }

v2 = v.Vector[1,1,1]

v1.sub(v2)
```
